## Description

Our motivation for this project was to make a website as group in order to aquire a basic understanding of how coding in a team would work in the industry. We decided on a multi-Api website that aquired planetary and weather data.

Over the course of this project we have all learned a great deal about code conflict management, how to delegate tasks correctly, how to merge different branches, and how to effectively use gitbash.

## Installation

For the source code follow these steps:

1: Download repository from github
2: Save where desired
3: Open file using a text editor of your choice

For the website iself follow these steps:

1: Follow link provided in this repository

## Usage

The way you use this website is as follows:

1: Type in a city of your choice in the search bar.
2: Then the weather conditions of that location will show, telling you if it decent weather to go out stargazing.
3: A list of planets that would be visible to you are also shown underneath the weather, as well as their location, and some      information about them.
4: The location the user inputted will be added to the search history underneath the search bar, as well as saved to local storage. Refreshing the page would still keep the previously searched locations present.
5: Clicking on any of the locations in the search history will bring up weather and visible planet data for that location.
6: Should the user leave the search bar blank, or enter a location that isn't a city they will get a message asking them to do so.

## Credits

The weather API we used in this project was gained from OpenWeather, the API is known as One Call API. 
Here is a link to the site:

For the planetary data we used the Visible Planets API.
Here is a link to their github repo:

We also used a framework called Semantic UI.
